# Hoobank

A responsive, simple, and modern looking landing page with dark gradients and overall nice color scheme and typeface. However, the main goal of this project was to get additional insight into the process of transforming a figma design into a homepage by using tailwind framework. There is little to no logic implemented and no third party code was utilized, in that regard the whole thing could have been coded up with just vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. The reason why I went for React was that the guide I was following along required it.
